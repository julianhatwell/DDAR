## Visualising Categorical Data
  
**Rigorous statistical analysis of categorical data is not only supported by visual tools, it is best performed visually.**

*The main theme of Michael Friendly's work.*

# Case Study

## Analysis of Negative Trend in Student Outcomes

Academic life-cycle data for undergraduates. 2014 and 2015 intakes, graduating in 2017 and 2018 respectively. In 2018, rates of non-graduation (fails and withdrawals) were found to be significantly higher than the previous year.

An analysis was conducted to determine the factors associated with this trend.

*This is a synthetic data set, designed to replicate and exaggerate some problems found in a real life scenario*

## Academic Data

```{r acad_data1}
cat("Total Students")
nrow(sts)
summary(sts[, 1:3])
summary(sts[, 9:10])
```

## Limitations of Working with Tables Directly

```{r fchq}
structable(with(sts, table(grad, year)))
structable(with(sts, table(faculty, hqual)))
```

## Naive Approach: Barplots

Which is the right grouping variable?

Can we succinctly describe the relationship?

```{r not_intuitive, fig.fullwidth=TRUE, fig.height = 4}
my_gbars <- function(g) {
        g + stat_identity(geom = "bar"
                          , position = position_dodge()) +
                myGgFillScale4 +
                theme_bw() +
                myGgTheme
}

hf <- as.data.frame(with(sts, table(faculty, hqual)))
g1 <- ggplot(data = as.data.frame(hf)
             , aes(x = hqual
                   , fill = faculty
                   , y = Freq))
g1 <- my_gbars(g1)


g2 <- ggplot(data = as.data.frame(hf)
             , aes(x = faculty
                   , fill = hqual
                   , y = Freq))

g2 <- my_gbars(g2)

grid.arrange(g1, g2, nrow=1)
```

## Fourfold Plots

```{r ffold1, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='70%'}
fourfold(with(sts, table(grad, year)))
```

A specialised plot for 2 $\times$ 2 contingency tables which exposes the log odds ratio. A significant difference in the ratios shows up as non-overlapping CI.

## Fourfold Plots

Fourfold plots are automatically stratified over the levels of a third feature, when given a $2 \times 2 \times k$ table.

```{r ffold2, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='70%'}
fourfold(with(sts, table(grad, year, faculty)))
```

## Fourfold Plots

```{r ffold3, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='70%'}
fourfold(with(sts, table(grad, year, hqual)))
```

## Correspondence Analysis

An unsupervised/clustering Method. R Package "ca". 

Simple ca, the ca() function, operates on just two features. It determines per level associations. 

Multiple/Joint ca, the mjca() function, operates simultaneously on two or more features. mjca is harder to interpret and not shown here.

```{r sts_ca, echo=TRUE}
sts_ca_hq_out <- ca(with(sts, table(hqual, outcome)))

sts_ca_fc_out <- ca(with(sts, table(faculty, outcome)))
```

## Correspondence Analysis

```{r plot_ca1}
# Generate the plot
res.ca <- plot(sts_ca_hq_out)
# add some segments from the origin to make things clearer
segments(0, 0, res.ca$cols[,1], res.ca$cols[,2], col = "red", lwd = 1)
segments(0, 0, res.ca$rows[,1], res.ca$rows[,2], col = "blue", lwd = 1, lty = 3)
```

## Correspondence Analysis

```{r plot_ca2}
# Generate the plot
res.ca <- plot(sts_ca_fc_out)
# add some segments from the origin to make things clearer
segments(0, 0, res.ca$cols[,1], res.ca$cols[,2], col = "red", lwd = 1)
segments(0, 0, res.ca$rows[,1], res.ca$rows[,2], col = "blue", lwd = 1, lty = 3)
```

## Extending Simple Correspondence Analysis

A pivot table creates rows for combos of > 1 feature.

```{r disp_struct, echo=TRUE}
structable(outcome ~ hqual + faculty, data = sts)
```

## Correspondence Analysis

```{r sts_ca_struc}
sts_ca_hqfc_out <- ca(as.matrix(
  # structable is a pivot table function
  structable(outcome ~ hqual + faculty
  , data = sts)))
```

```{r plot_ca3}
# Generate the plot
res.ca <- plot(sts_ca_hqfc_out)
# add some segments from the origin to make things clearer
segments(0, 0, res.ca$cols[,1], res.ca$cols[,2], col = "red", lwd = 1)
segments(0, 0, res.ca$rows[,1], res.ca$rows[,2], col = "blue", lwd = 1, lty = 3)
```

## Introducing the Strucplot Framework

* Purpose built for handling tables - no dependent/independent variables.
* Respects the table structure given.
* Several Variants: mosaic, sieve, tile, assoc, spine, doubledecker
* Mosaic is the most versatile and supports higher dimensional data
* Fourfold is also part of the strucplot framework but uniquely specialised for $2 \times 2$ contingency tables and log odds ratio tests.

## faculty Marginal Totals

```{r f_marg}
mosaic(with(sts, table(faculty))
       , gp = shading_Friendly2
       , labeling = labeling_values
       , spacing = spacing_equal(sp = unit(0.5, "lines"))
       , value_type = "observed"
       , gp_text = gpar(fontface = 1))
```

## hqual Marginal Totals

```{r h_marg}
mosaic(with(sts, table(hqual))
       , gp = shading_Friendly2
       , split_vertical = TRUE
       , labeling = labeling_values
       , spacing = spacing_equal(sp = unit(0.5, "lines"))
       , value_type = "observed"
       , gp_text = gpar(fontface = 1))

```

## Expected Frequencies (Assume Independence)

```{r exp_freqs}
expected <- independence_table(with(sts, table(faculty, hqual)))

mosaic(expected
      , gp = shading_Friendly2
      , labeling = labeling_values
      , spacing = spacing_equal(sp = unit(0.5, "lines"))
      , value_type = "expected"
      , gp_text = gpar(fontface = 1))
```

## Observed Frequencies

```{r fh_actuals}
mosaic(with(sts, table(faculty, hqual))
      , gp = shading_Friendly2
      , labeling = labeling_values
      , spacing = spacing_equal(sp = unit(0.5, "lines"))
      , value_type = "observed"
      , gp_text = gpar(fontface = 1))
```

## Scaling to Higher Dimensions

```{r hd_mosaic}
my_mosaic(with(sts, table(faculty, hqual, grad, year)))
```

## Example Code

```{r mosample, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mosaic(my_table
       # shading function
       , gp = shading_Friendly2
       # tile spacing
       , spacing = spacing_equal(sp = unit(0.4, "lines"))
       # label positioning
       , rot_labels = c(0, -30, -45, 90)
       , rot_varnames = c(0, -90, 0, 90)
       , offset_labels = c(0, 0.5, 0, 0)
       , offset_varnames = c(0, 1, 0, 0.5))
```

## Loglinear Models

Two discrete variables *A* with *I* possible values and  *B* with *J* possible values. A sample can be described by an *I* $\times$ *J* contingency table

Under independence, each cell count $n_{ij}$ in the table is assumed to be a Poisson distributed random variable:
  
$$n_{ij} \sim \mathit{Pois}(\frac{n_{i+} \cdot n_{+j}}{n_{++}})$$
$n_{i+} = \mathrm{row\ total},\ n_{+j} = \mathrm{col\ total},\ n_{++} = \mathrm{table\ total}$

## Loglinear Models

Rearranging, we get a model that is linear in all the logs:

$$\log(\frac{n_{i+} \cdot n_{+j}}{n_{++}}) = \log(n_{i+}) + \log(n_{+j}) - \log(n_{++})$$

This is usually represented as:

$$\mu + \lambda^A_i + \lambda^B_j$$

where $\mu$ is in "intercept" term that is a property of the total count and the $\lambda$ terms are the "main" effects.

Under independence, the main effects can be calculated directly from the marginal totals.

## Loglinear Models

Deviation from independence implies an interaction term:
  
$$\mu + \lambda^A_i + \lambda^B_j + \lambda^{AB}_{ij}$$
  
To allow for estimation, we constrain: $\sum^I_{i = 1} \lambda^{A}_{i} = 0,\ \sum^J_{j = 1} \lambda^{B}_{i} = 0,\ \sum^I_{i = 1} \lambda^{AB}_{ij} = \sum^J_{j = 1} \lambda^{AB}_{ij} = 0$.

This scales to more variables as follows:
  
$$\mu + \lambda^A_i + \lambda^B_j + \lambda^C_k + \lambda^{AB}_{ij} + \lambda^{BC}_{jk} + \lambda^{AC}_{ik} + \lambda^{ABC}_{ijk}$$
  
The model with all parameters (one for each table cell) included is referred to as the saturated model - we can always fit the data, but learn nothing.

## Loglinear Models

When modelling, we seek the most parsimious, best fit. Find a model that is:
  
* as "good" as the saturated model - non-significant residuals
* does not use all the parameters / degrees of freedom

This can be done using:
  
* generalised linear models (family = poisson)
* comparing various interactions (joint, conditional)
* dummy variables can capture very specific interactions

Building models using domain knowledge and visual inspection mosaic plots for significant residuals is the recommended approach.

Compare and select the best model using anova tests and AIC/BIC.

## Null Model `[F][H][G][Y]`

                    , glm3, glm4, glm5))
```

## Diagnostic Tests

```{r diag_lr, echo=TRUE}
LRstats(glm4)
LRstats(glm5)
```

## Case Study Conclusions

A policy change between 2014 and 2015 to increase student numbers led to lowering of entry level thresholds.

The foundation diploma appears not to have met the needs of so many additional students on the more challenging finance degree.

Recommend a review of curriculum and resources for the diploma to better support finance students, as well as interventions and support for students who are already one or two years into their course.
